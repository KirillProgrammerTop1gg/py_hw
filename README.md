# 🐍 Python Learning Repository

This repository contains my Python homework projects built while learning backend development, web scraping, and database integration using Flask.

Each sub-project focuses on applying Python in real-world scenarios such as building web applications, parsing data from external websites, working with databases, and generating dynamic content.

### 🔹 hw_22 — Сфера: Social Messenger Web App

A full-featured social networking and messaging web application built with Flask. Users can register, log in, manage friendships, and exchange private messages in real time — all through a modern, dark-themed UI.

- Features:
  - User registration and authentication with hashed passwords
  - Session-based login/logout via Flask-Login
  - Friend system: send, accept, and decline friend requests
  - Private messaging between confirmed friends
  - New messages inbox with unread message tracking
  - Full message thread view per sender
  - CSRF protection on all forms using Flask-WTF
  - Semantic HTML templates with BEM CSS methodology
  - Responsive dark UI built with custom CSS (no frameworks)
  - Jinja2 template inheritance via `base.html` with `{% extends %}` and `{% block %}`

- Security:
  - All state-changing routes are protected with CSRF tokens
  - Every form includes `{{ form.hidden_tag() }}` which renders a hidden `<input>` with a signed CSRF token generated by Flask-WTF
  - The token is validated server-side on every `POST` request — requests without a valid token are rejected with a `400 Bad Request`
  - Passwords are never stored in plain text — hashed before saving to the database
  - All user-facing routes require authentication via `@login_required`

- Libraries used:
  - `flask`
  - `flask-login`
  - `flask-wtf`
  - `wtforms`
  - `sqlalchemy`
